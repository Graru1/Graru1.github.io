# Bounce and Jumpbug Checker
This is a tool for the Team Fortress 2 jumping community to calculate bounces, special starts and angeled bounces.

# How to use the tool
Enter height...: Enter a height which is equal or higher than one. This will be the distance from your standing position to the surface where you want to bounce on.

Enter ceiling gap...: Enter a height which is equal or higher than 63. This will be the distance from the ceiling to the surface where you want to bounce on.

60.00: Enter a custom angle from 45 to 89. This will be used for angled bounces.
